# Benchmarx

Benchmarx provides a convenient interface for benchmarking optimization 
methods. This package provides a simple implementation of benchmarking 
functions for optimization tasks and provides the ability to use standard 
methods from jaxopt as well as to implement your own method. The results 
of the experiments are saved in all details in a json file, which can be 
used to visualize the data in graphs. Refer to the examples for details.
